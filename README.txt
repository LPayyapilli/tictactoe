Hiya friend!

This web app was created by Luke Payyapilli with the help of numerous people including Max Blauschild, Andrew Something, Aaron Weinberg, and Valeria Something.

It is May 15th 2015 and this is version 1.0

This web app allows two users (two computers) to play tic tac toe with each other. Additional functionality includes a chat window and a win counter (specifically designed for smack talk)

Enjoy!!

You can provide feedback at luke.payyapilli@gmail.com if you have any improvements you would like to see.
