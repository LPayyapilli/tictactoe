Hiya friend!

This web app was created by Luke Payyapilli.

It is May 15th 2015 and this is version 1.0

This web app allows two users (two computers) to play tic tac toe with each other. Additional functionality includes a chat window and a win counter (specifically designed for smack talk).

I used Jquery, bootstrap, the css.animate library, and firebase to create this application.

Enjoy!!
